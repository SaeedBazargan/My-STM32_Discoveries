## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to **DevHeads** for their [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XJ4M31ZvH0&list=PL2mKSkagAaJjjnVujAPwVsZobEfADTAxN&index=3)  
and **Shawn Hymel** for his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDFWCxrJruQ&t=742s).

## The way I took:
I used a Linux system for building TensorFlow Lite Micro, and I recommend you do the same:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro.git

2. cd tflite-micro
3. ```bash
   make -f tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/Makefile TARGET=cortex_m_generic TARGET_ARCH=cortex-m4 microlite
For more details, [check the](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro/blob/main/tensorflow/lite/micro/cortex_m_generic/README.md)
